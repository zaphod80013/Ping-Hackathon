- ## Presentation thoughts
	- intro slide (problem definition)
		- Taking notes is Easy, Retrieving Information is hard.
		- Confluence is poorly suited for Information retrieval.
	- Project goal
		- What is  Logseq (pronounced Log-seek)
		- Evaluate Logseq as:
			- A better information retrieval tool
			- Alternative to Confluence
			- Meta index on top of confluence
	- Demo
		- features to cover
			- journal for raw data entry
				- reduced cognitive load, i.e. Separate organizing data from data entry
				- Workflow Management (? off-topic)
			- Graph view
				- Dril Down
				- Search
				- Journal on/off
			- MindMap
				- Drill Down
				- Collapse / Expand nodes
			- Graph Analysis Tool
				- Drill down by number of hops
				- What else?
			- Other
				- Collaboration through git (? time constraint)
				- Switching between personal/team graphs
	- Issue
		- Importing / syncing data from/with Confluence (automation?)
		- Product focus is personal knowledge management, real-time collaboration is in development
		- Beta Product
